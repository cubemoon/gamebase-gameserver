GameBase Lobby and Game Server
-----------------

The GameBase Lobby and Game server is intended to be a reusable lobby and game server, allowing developers to easily create multiplayer games using WebSockets without having to reinvent the wheel with regards to a lobbying and game creation system.

The primary focus is the actual Node.js server implementation, but client libraries will be provided to allow easy access to the functions of the server.
